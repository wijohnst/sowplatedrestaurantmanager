      '<li>Cobia are the only member of the family Rachycentridae in North America.</li>\n' +
      '<li>They grow up to 6 feet and 100 pounds and live up to 12 years.</li>\n' +
      '<li>They are able to reproduce when they are young—females mature at age 3 and males mature at age 2.</li>\n' +
      '<li>Cobia spawn in coastal bays and estuaries several times throughout their spawning season, which lasts from late June to mid-August in the Southeast and from late summer to early fall in the Gulf of Mexico. Females release between 375,000 and 2 million eggs each time they spawn.</li>\n' +
      '<li>They are strong, aggressive predators, mainly feeding on crustaceans but also fish and squid. Larger pelagic fish prey on young cobia.</li>\n' +
